Dynamic Pricing Engine for Retail Products
This project builds a dynamic pricing engine by analyzing retail sales data.
Performed extensive data cleaning, feature engineering (time-based and product-based features), and built predictive models using Random Forest Regression.
Achieved 90% RÂ² score, with strong performance metrics (MAE: 0.075, RMSE: 7.18).
The final model is saved and ready for deployment as a price prediction service.

ðŸš€ Tech Stack Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost)

EDA and Feature Engineering (Datetime Features, Rolling Demand Metrics)

Modeling Techniques (Random Forest, K-Fold Cross Validation)

Model Evaluation (RÂ² Score, MAE, RMSE)

Model Serialization (Joblib for saving the final model)

ðŸŒŸ Key Highlights
Built a rolling 7-day demand feature for each product to capture short-term sales trends.

Compared multiple models (Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost) and finalized the best one.

Achieved high prediction accuracy suitable for real-world dynamic pricing applications.

Organized project structure following industry-standard ML project workflow.

Saved the model for easy future deployment or API integration.
